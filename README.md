## Algorithms on Graphs Programming Assignment 05: Minimum Spanning Trees
### Problems
Practice implementing algorithms computing minimum spanning trees:
* [`/src/connecting_points/ConnectingPoints.java`](src/connecting_points/ConnectingPoints.java): Problem 1, Building Roads to Connect Cities, builds roads between some pairs of the given cities such that there is a path between any two cities and the total length of the roads is minimized (PASSED);
* [`/src/clustering/Clustering.java`](src/clustering/Clustering.java): Problem 2, Clustering, partitions a given set of objects into subsets (or clusters) in such a way that any two objects from the same subset are close (or similar) to each other, while any two objects from different subsets are far apart (PASSED).
